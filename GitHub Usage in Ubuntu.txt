Step 1: Open the Terminal and  type  sudo apt-get install git
Step 2: Goto www.github.com and sign into your account. If you’re a new user, you can simply sign-up.
CONFIGURING GIT:

Step 1: Go back to the terminal and type this to configure git

git config –global user.name “your_username”

Step 2: Now type this to link your email too.

git config –global user.email “your_emailid”

USING GIT:

Step 1: Go to your github account and create a repository with a name(lets say name of your project). We are creating a repository with the name myproject

Step 2: Make a folder with the name of your project and change your current directory to that  directory.

mkdir myproject

cd myproject

Step 3: Now we want to initiate Git for this folder

git init

Step 4: Now we will set up the remote, which tells git where the repository is located.

git remote add origin  https://github.com/your_username/myproject.git

Step 5: To add this file we will type

git add helloworld.c

Or if we have a lot of files to be transferred from the folder to our git account, then we can use the command.

git add .


Step 6: Next, when we are finished adding the files, then we will have to commit adding.

git commit -m ‘your_message’

Step 7: Next, we need to push the commit that we just made on to the repository at github

git push origin master

It would automatically ask you for your username and password for github. After entering the details, go to github and refresh. The files would get added there.

Username for ‘ https://github.com ‘: your_username

Password for ‘ https://your_username@github.com ‘ : *******

Step 8: We have successfully transferred a file on your github account. Now lets add one more file aboutme.txt and edit our file helloworld.c . Following the same procedure we will first add the files, commit and then push them to the github account.

git add .
git commit -m ‘your_message’   
git push origin master


Step 9: When we would go to our github account, we would see the entire hierarchy of the modification of the file. Here,we would see the changes we made to the helloworld.c file in the respective commits.

Step 10: First he would have to download the whole repository in which the file helloworld.c is present into his system.

git clone https://github.com/your_username/myproject.git

A folder named myproject gets downloaded with all the files in it. The necessary changes are made and then the file is similarly added, committed and pushed similarly as above.


Step 11: If the first user wish to see the changes, then he can see it by typing:

git pull origin master
